# Run Log

本文件记录所有实验命令、Azure 资源、运行结果和错误。

## 2026-07-08 — Repository reset

Action:

- Replaced existing repository contents with the final experiment plan and Copilot execution prompt.

No Azure resources were created in this step.

Next expected runs:

1. Phase 0.5 J-lens feasibility and saturation spike.
2. Phase 1 behavioral reasoning-depth gradient.

## 2026-07-08 — Executable scaffold implementation

Action:

- Implemented Phase 0.5 and Phase 1 executable scaffold
- Created all core Python modules:
  - `src/jspace_observation/config.py`: Configuration management
  - `src/jspace_observation/model_loader.py`: Hugging Face model loading
  - `src/jspace_observation/no_cot.py`: Strict no-CoT utilities with empty-think prefill
  - `src/jspace_observation/prompt_sets.py`: Pilot prompt generation (arithmetic, synthetic relation, factual/counterfactual)
  - `src/jspace_observation/eval_parsing.py`: Answer parsing and evaluation
  - `src/jspace_observation/stats.py`: Wilson CI and bootstrap utilities
  - `src/jspace_observation/run_logging.py`: Run tracking and metadata
  - `src/jspace_observation/jlens_utils.py`: J-lens availability checking
- Implemented experiment scripts:
  - `experiments/phase0_5_jlens_spike.py`: J-lens feasibility spike
  - `experiments/phase1_depth_gradient.py`: Behavioral reasoning-depth gradient
- Created unit tests (tests/test_no_cot.py, test_eval_parsing.py, test_stats.py)
- Set up Azure infrastructure:
  - `infra/azure/scripts/00_check_prereqs.sh`: Prerequisites checking
  - `infra/azure/scripts/01_build_and_push_image.sh`: Docker build and push
  - `infra/azure/scripts/02_run_phase0_5.sh`: Phase 0.5 job submission
  - `infra/azure/scripts/03_run_phase1.sh`: Phase 1 job submission
- Created Makefile for common operations
- All changes committed to git

Next action:

- Run `make test` to verify unit tests pass
- Run `make phase0-5` for local Phase 0.5 spike
- Run `make phase1-dry` for Phase 1 dry-run
- Setup Azure and submit jobs if needed

## 2026-07-08 — Scaffold sync verification before GitHub push

Action:

- Verified local branch state before pushing: `main` was ahead of `origin/main` by one implementation commit.
- Verified required implementation files exist locally, including all core modules, Phase 0.5/Phase 1 scripts, tests, Makefile, and Azure scripts.
- Implementation summary:
  - Phase 0.5 J-lens feasibility scaffold is implemented in `experiments/phase0_5_jlens_spike.py`.
  - Phase 1 behavioral depth-gradient scaffold is implemented in `experiments/phase1_depth_gradient.py`.
  - Strict no-CoT utilities, prompt sets, parsing, stats, run logging, model loading, and J-lens availability helpers are implemented under `src/jspace_observation/`.
  - Lightweight tests are implemented under `tests/`.

Test command:

- Requested command: `make test`
- Result: not executable in this Windows environment because `make` is not installed.
- Equivalent Makefile target command run: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Test result: `41 passed, 2 warnings`

Azure:

- No Azure resources were created in this step.

## 2026-07-08 — Strict no-CoT and Phase 0.5 clarification fixes

Action:

- Moved R1-Distill strict no-CoT empty-think prefill after the base prompt and before an `Answer:` cue:
  - `{base_prompt}`
  - `<think>\n</think>`
  - `Answer:`
- Added `r1_style_thinking` to the default Phase 1 conditions.
- Clarified Phase 0.5 script status as an availability/model-loading check only.
- Clarified Phase 0.5 summary fields for pre-fitted lens search, jacobian-lens availability, model loading, and actual tiny fitting attempted/success.

Test command:

- `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Test result: `41 passed, 2 warnings`

Azure:

- No Azure resources were created in this step.
